Project Abstract

Udio is a textbook trading platform designed specifically for University students, and will be tested with SFU students only on release. 
Sellers will be able to list their used textbook on websites, specify their books,  and post pictures to show the quality of their books, 
and ask for a price. Buyers will then be able to purchase the books from them through our websiteâ€™s listing pages. Listings will be grouped 
by book, and can be filtered by price and conditions. Listing pages will also have a chart of the high, low, and mean prices of past sales 
for any given books, so the buyers and sellers will know the accepted prices of the books they are going to purchase/sell. Logins and profiles 
will be created with Google and Facebook and other APIs, and transactions will be handled with paypal with buyers paying in advance.
