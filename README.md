Project Abstract

Udio is a textbook trading platform designed specifically for University students, and will be tested with SFU students only on release. 
Sellers will be able to list their used textbook on websites, specify their books,  and post pictures to show the quality of their books, 
and ask for a price. Buyers will then be able to purchase the books from them through our website’s listing pages. Listings will be grouped 
by book, and can be filtered by price and conditions. Listing pages will also have a chart of the high, low, and mean prices of past sales 
for any given books, so the buyers and sellers will know the accepted prices of the books they are going to purchase/sell. Logins and profiles 
will be created with Google and Facebook and other APIs, and transactions will be handled with paypal with buyers paying in advance.

<strong> This project is in its final stage of development, for its purpose as a class project.<\strong> In order to view the app locally, please follow these instructions:
  
Step 0: Initialize Git

Step 1: Clone the github repository https://github.com/Nan-L/cmpt276-b/ 

Step 2: Install Ruby (version 2.5 was used for this project)
https://gorails.com/setup/ is a good guide for installation on Ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows systems

Step 3: Install Bundler gem (“gem install bundler”)

Step 4: Install Rails framework (version 5.1 was used for this project)
https://gorails.com/setup/ can be helpful here as well.

Step 5: run terminal command “bundle install --without production” in the project root directory

Step 6: Run Puma server (included with ruby on rails, via command “bin/rails server”) in the project root directory.

Step 7: Maintain internet connection if working with any of the APIs, as they pull information from various internet sources and will not work properly if these sources cannot be reached.
